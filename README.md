## Project Overview
Adidas, the renowned German sportswear giant recognized worldwide by its iconic 'Three Stripes' logo, partners with various retailers across the United States to expand its reach and drive profitability. However, the onset of COVID-19 in 2020 drastically reshaped the retail landscape. Mandated lockdowns and social distancing measures led to significant disruptions, forcing many businesses to adapt to sudden changes—or face financial losses and potential closure.

This project aims to analyze the impact—both positive and negative—of the pandemic's first two years on Adidas' retail sales. By collaborating with the sales and marketing teams, I will partner with the head of sales and marketing to extract valuable insights and provide actionable recommendations to enhance marketing efforts and drive sales growth in a post-pandemic world.

## Excecutive Summary
This analysis examines nearly 10,000 sales records from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021, revealing total revenue of approximately $900 million. Men's Street Footwear emerged as the leading product category, contributing 23.21% of total revenue. A significant shift toward e-commerce was observed, with online sales accounting for 50.7% of total revenue, surpassing in-store sales, which represented 49.3%.

To capitalize on these findings, Adidas should prioritize investments in online platforms, such as websites and mobile apps, to better serve customers who cannot access brick-and-mortar stores. Additionally, focusing on high-performing categories like Men's Street Footwear while reevaluating underperforming products can drive sustainable growth and strengthen market presence in the post-pandemic era.
